# Channel Intro

MJ and Dave have a weekly discussion about latest technology in data and AI for the past 12 months. With the launch of ChatGPT 2022 and so many other amazing technologies following that, we have a strong feeling that the next generation may live in a different world than the one that we are in. As we both have two young children, the conversations natrually lean towards how can we better prepare them for the future.

In this video, we talked about the huge shift in **responsibility** for a lot of working parents after Covid. As we get to spend a lot more time with our family, the expectation and reality both changed. How can we take advantage of this change to create positive impacts on our kids when it comes to technology?

## Kids

MJ has two boys Andriel (2017) and Archie (2021), Dave has two boys Martin (2014) and Harry (2018). Andriel is also in a spectrum with unique learning needs.

## Topics

Some of the topics that Dave and MJ plan to discuss on their channel include 3D printing, gaming, apps, screen time, school apps, and special learning needs. David and MJ believe that there is a lot of value in talking about these topics with other parents. They hope that their channel will be a community where parents can share their experiences and learn from each other.

## Conclusion

David and MJ are committed to making this channel a success. They plan to keep the channel updated on a weekly or fortnightly basis. They also encourage viewers to leave comments and suggestions. We believe that this channel is for parents like them and that it can be a valuable resource for parents who are struggling to raise their kids in the modern world.
