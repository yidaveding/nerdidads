# GenAI for Personalised Education

Dave and MJ explore how parents can leverage AI technology to engage children's interests and enhance learning experiences. As self-proclaimed tech-savvy fathers, they share practical examples of creating personalized, character-based learning interactions for their children.

## The Inspiration: Brave New Words

David begins by referencing Sal Khan's book "Break New Words," which explores how AI can transform education for future generations. Khan, founder of Khan Academy, was among the first educators approached by OpenAI to explore AI applications in learning. One concept that caught David's attention was role-playing with AI personas like Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein to make learning physics more engaging.

Inspired by this approach, David decided to experiment with Microsoft's Copilot Studio to create something similar for his son Martin, who is interested in the Japanese comic series One Piece and its Roblox game adaptation, Blox Fruit.

David demonstrates how he created a Copilot persona based on Luffy, the main character from One Piece. The setup process was surprisingly simple:

- He provided basic instructions like "You are Luffy from One Piece" and "You talk to kids about your adventures in One Piece".
- He specified that the AI should adopt Luffy's casual speaking style rather than sounding like a professor.
- He added knowledge from the One Piece fandom website.
- He integrated the character into Microsoft Teams with just a few clicks.

David shows an example conversation where his son asks Luffy questions about his strongest opponents, to which the AI responds in character with relevant knowledge about the series.

## Personalized Coaching Through AI
Taking the concept further, David created another character based on Gregg Popovich, the legendary San Antonio Spurs basketball coach, to help with his son's basketball training. David shares how he asks the AI coach questions like "What do you do if a player is not self-motivated enough to meet training goals?" and receives thoughtful, practical advice.

David explains how he can refine the AI by providing more context, such as specifying that his son is "struggling to switch from point guard to small forward," and by adjusting the communication style to be more conversational rather than presenting information in bullet points.

## Future Possibilities and Optimism
MJ expresses his excitement about these applications but notes his frustration that this technology isn't yet available on devices like Google Home or Alexa. He envisions a future where these AI characters could be voice-activated without needing to open an app.

The conversation shifts to a broader perspective on technology, with both hosts expressing optimism about the future. MJ mentions Bill Gates' book "Source Code," which takes an optimistic view of technology's role in advancing human civilization. David agrees, advocating for "practical optimism" rather than blind optimism, especially when facing significant technological changes.

## Conclusion
Through their exploration of AI for personalized learning, David and MJ demonstrate how parents can harness emerging technologies to connect with their children's interests while creating educational opportunities in a fun, engaging way.
