# My Creality Ender V3 SE Printer is FINALLY Printing!

It's been mostly a frustrating trying to figure out the 3D printer in the past 2-3 weeks. To a point that I had to call Jaycar Australia back for some help. And HELP received! They've asked me to print the 3D Benchy test print.

## Kids reaction

Both boys are pretty excited when they see the physical little grey boat sitting at the printer when we got home. We've tried different prints as well with very limited success. I'll show them more about the model convertion tool next time.

## 3D Benchy - Test Print

I think the design of 3D Benchy model is somehow suitable for filament 3D printers. After the cheetah print in comparison is no where near the quality of the Benchy model.

## Print Plat problem

I've already ruined some areas of the print plate. The filament can be really difficult to peel off. I accidentally cut my fingers as well. I will need to get some other tools that can allow me to apply more forces.

## Model download and Print software

The models are free to download from [Thangs.com](Thangs.com). While it is easy to search, more attention is required to understand the dimension of the model and also the potential issues associated with the model design.

Creality print is the software that's used to load the model and convert it into a gcode file for printing.

## Conclusion

Has been lots of learning this week. The main achievement other than the printed models, is to have gained a broad understanding the various components involved from hardware to filament to the configurations to the models and the slicing tool. For a successful print, all these aspects needs to be aligned.

## Notes for future
- explore more model designs
- continue to calibrate the printer
- replace the plate
- be patient!
