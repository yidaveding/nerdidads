# Creating Comms App for speech delayed kid

MJ's 7 year old son Andriel has speech delay. This means that he is able to speak, but he has difficulty doing so. MJ have been exploring a lot of different AAC apps to help him communicate. However, most of the apps in the App stores are either too expensive and also designed for kids who can't speak at all (mute). So, MJ decided to build his own custom AAC app for Andriel, one that will not only help with his communication, but also encourage him to speak and learn.

## Building a Custom AAC App

The app has a UI design that allows Andriel to select the envrionmenn his in, e.g. restaurant or classroom. It will then bring up common objects (with picture) related to to context. Once the object is selected it will speak the word. For speech delayed kids, learning new vocabulary can be a big challenge. The app will pronounce the object. Over time, this may help the kid to remember the new vocabulary.

## Conclusion

Very early stage of the App. This can be deployed onto Andriel's iPad. There is then the training element. Will look forward to the future updates on this App.
